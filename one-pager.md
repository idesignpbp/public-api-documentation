  What is an API?

  An Application Programming Interface (API) is another way for you to communicate with Trinity.  Think of it as speaking a different language.  You use one language (Workflow) to place orders and may use a few others (such as our Skiffle iOS app, Studio, or our factory tablet systems) to interact with us.  The API is a computer to computer connection that simply cuts out the middleman.  Currently our API is read-only for dealers (you can't place orders yet) and read-and-write for manufacturers.

  How can I use the API?

  To use our API you will need to talk with our support team about getting API access. We'll have an introductory call to set expectations on what our API can do, verify that you have the resources to <a href="https://technologyadvice.com/blog/information-technology/how-to-use-an-api/">make use of it</a>, and set you up with an API token. Generally, we expect that you have someone technical who can understand the API documentation and understand how to access it. You will either write custom software applications to access it or integrate it with a sophisticated third-party tool like Zapier.
